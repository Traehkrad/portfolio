            <h2>Program Curriculum</h2>
              <p>CSUEB is on a quarter system. The M.A. in Multimedia with a
                concentration in Interaction Design requires a 34-semerster-unit
                minimum. Most students, by their own choice, take more than the
                minimum requirements. Electives are drawn from the entire spectrum
                of courses at CSU East Bay and can include many different disciplines.

              <p>Advanced practitioners at the intersections of art, science, and technology present and discuss their work in a dynamic and open format with students. Students are actively engaged in a conversation about current trends and paradigms in contemporary media.</p>
              <p>MM 680 - Interactive Content Development Units: 3</p>
              <p>Team-based interactive content development and management with work on faculty-derived projects. Students synthesize and apply skills in a production environment, then critique and refine processes to optimize creative productivity</p>
              <p>MM 682 - Individual Multimedia Research and Practice Units: 3</p>
              <p>A series of structured and customized individual research and development modules designed to prepare each student for the capstone project. Socially responsible practice and professional standards of sophistication and productivity are emphasized.</p>
              <p>MM 694 - Project Documentation Units: 1 (this course will be taken twice; once in the first semester of the second year and again as part of the capstone experience.)</p>
              <p>Writing clear, complete, structured and persuasive documentation of multimedia projects for production, publication, promotion and/or grant applications. Professional and effective use of supporting graphics, charts, citation and bibliographies. </p>


            <h3>Interaction Design Concentration</h3>
              <p>Interaction Design, for 17 units, focuses on the creation of meaningful
              experiences expressed as interactive applications and objects. Students
              analyze interactivity in art, design, and everyday life; acquire skills
              and develop prototypes; and work in collaborative teams to creatively
              solve real world problems.</p>

            <h3>Interaction Design Core</h3>
              <p>Two (2) courses for 6 units are required:</p>
              <p>MM 621 - Screen Based Interaction Units: 3</p>
              <p>Study of the process of designing screen based interactive prototypes within the contexts of apps, games, the web. Students use various tools, including simple scripting, to create prototypes and then test and refine them.</p>
              <p>MM 622 - Physical Prototyping Units: 3</p>
              <p>Explore interactivity with physical objects. Study of the process of designing interactive prototypes, both autonomous and networked. Students use various tools, including simple scripting, 3D printing and microcontrollers, to create prototypes and then test and refine them.</p>

            <h3>Interaction Design Electives</h3>
              <p>Choose two (2) electives for 6 units:</p>
              <p>MM 665 - Experiments in Interactivity Units: 3 > This course has a different topic or theme each semester and can be repeated, subject to advisor approval.

Experimental studio course explores the territory at the intersection of the technical, scientific, entertainment and fine arts communities.</p>
              <p>MM 667 - Experiments in Storytelling Units: 3 > Explores various advanced-level strategies in storytelling using theory, production, and multimedia techniques and technologies. Determined by the program coordinator and thesis committee, the topics chosen will support the first project a student will complete on his/her own.</p>

            <h3>Interaction Design Capstone</h3>
              <p>The following 5 units are required to complete the program capstone:</p>
              <p>MM 693 - Interaction Design Capstone Project Units: 4 > Synthesis culminating in a comprehensive team based thesis project under the supervision of a faculty committee. The capstone course is an opportunity for students to demonstrate their comprehensive achievements in interaction design. Students’ projects are presented in a public forum.</p>
              <p>MM 694 - Project Documentation Units: 1</p>
              <p>Writing clear, complete, structured and persuasive documentation of multimedia projects for production, publication, promotion and/or grant applications. Professional and effective use of supporting graphics, charts, citation and bibliographies.</p>
