            <h3>What is the word?</h3>
              <p>I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. What would be needed were Americans in successive
                generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the
                reality of their time. That's the promise we need to keep. And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make
                to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically-elected
                government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all our troops from Iraq by 2012.</p>

            <h3>This is the reality we live in.</h3>
              <p>But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. In fact, it isn't even past." We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable
                sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced. So long as our relationship is defined by our
                differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United
                States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect; and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make
                true democracy.</p>

            <h3>Building a wall is not going to solve our problems!</h3>
              <p>The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. That anger is not always productive;
                indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real
                change. This time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem. He simply says to everyone in the room, "I am here because of Ashley." We must always
                examine the ways in which we protect it.</p>
