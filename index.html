            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
              <p>A Chinese American male who is interested in drawing and storytelling.
                My main medium for telling stories would be traditional manga and physical
                and digital video games. My main art style is traditional art with pencil,
                paper, pen, and eraser in manga style.</p>
              <p>I know a bit of coding involving Python, HTML, and C++, but I am
                one hundred percent solely interested in creating manga and stories,
                not websites or coding.</p>

          <section class="cell small-4" id="explanation">
            <h3>Stories to Tell</h3>
              <p>My inspirations for my stories can originate from a multitude of things,
                from the common and mundane objects to the extraordinary. I hope that through
                my stories that other people could be inspired and learn certain philosophical lessons
                from them.</p>
              <p>My favorite stories come from manga, comics, movies, and novels and my preferred genres
                are Fantasy and Science Fiction.</p>

          <section class="cell small-4" id="explanation">
            <h3>My Team Role</h3>
              <p>Outside of art, I have had experience in teaching, cooperation, and team leading.
                In high school, I volunteered as a tutor there which helped me with interacting with
                a variety of people.</p>
              <p>Later, I would begin my own Manga Drawing Club near the end of my
                high school years and learned the difficulty of managing a team larger than the amount of
                people in my class projects.</p>
              <p>In my early college years, I attempted to recruit students into my game design team
                and began on a project that didn't get very far. I learned the difficult way about
                communication and tailoring the skill set and experience of my members after we fell out.</p>
